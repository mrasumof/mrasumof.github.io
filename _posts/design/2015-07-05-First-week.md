##A Dictionary, a list, a list of dictionaries, a dictionary of lists of tuples of lists...What the heck is going on????

Oh yeah! Here I am, my first day at Metis Data Science bootcamp. Happy, expectant to have formal training on a field
I wanted to get into for a long time. Actually, I was interested in this field even before it was called "Data Sciences".
Some years ago I almost apply to a Masters program in Belgium that was called "CRM Analytics". Things happen at the right
time and for a good reason. I am here now and will get the best out of this, my second career. 

Coming to Metis required me to take some on-line training in Python and some Statistics refresher. I did all the required
pre-work and felt internal confidence, but that would change in a matter of hours :smile: ...

We started talking about Python data structures, arrays, lists, dictionaries...I am cool..but then things started to get a
little bit more complex.

First problem set: let's download NYC MTA traffic data and load it to a dictionary that contains a list of tuples that
contains lists...excuse me, what???? I started to think that I am a little bit too "experienced" for this, to not say 
plainly old :smile:, which I am not!!!

Thank G-d, resilience is one of my treats and I do not give up on anything that easily. My motto the first week was: you CAN do it
, and you WILL do it!

So, after a week of few hours of sleep and a lot of programming, cursing, reading Python books, browsing Python tutorials, cursing
, asking for help to the instructors and classmates, and a little bit more of cursing, I made it through the week and was able to 
deliver the required analysis!!!

Super-proud of the accomplishment!

...things will get better...

Week 2, here I come!
